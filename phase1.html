Drawing from observations of users disorganizing between contexts such as rushing to meetings or classes. The cognitive load of mental task tracking, the project addresses the problem of immersion-induced unawareness in enclosed workspaces. It leverages underutilized wall space behind computer screens for peripheral, non-intrusive ambient cues, promoting visual depth to alleviate stress, as supported by research on alternating near-far focus.</p>

                        <p><b>Insights from Initial Field Observations</b>
                        </p><p>We began with observing 7 students in a library and 1 in a home environment but realized that the contexts are vastly different and that our system is designed for task shift. In the 40-minute observation sessions we had limited visibility to the intentions that our participants had for their day.</p>
                        <p><i>(To see detailed observations follow link here: <a href="https://airtable.com/appqtkyPvZABMxw2b/shrK8LW3HL2rfOdew">Airtable Observations</a>).</i></p>
                        <h4><b>A. Core Observational Findings (Limited)</b></h4>
                        <p>The library environment naturally promoted structure and focus for most of the participants. Our initial observations showed three task-based segments when looking at the commonalities between the students (below):</p>

                        <p><i>1. Consumption/Learning (e.g., reading academic texts, highlighting).</p>
                        <p>2. Researching/Browsing (e.g., multitasking on laptops, scattered online searches).</p>
                        <p>3. Output/Creation (e.g., writing documents, problem-solving exercises).</i></p>
                        <p>While the data revealed some interesting patterns, it was ultimately of limited use for the projector concept because it did not provide deeper insights into key areas:</p>
                        <p><b>1. Ambiguity of Internal State and Motivation</b>: Surface-level view of participants’ experiences. Signs of distraction or stress were rarely explicit, and visible cues such as posture shifts or fidgeting overlapped across multiple states. This made it impossible to accurately interpret whether participants were motivated, distracted, or frustrated; precisely the phenomena our ambient projector was designed to address.</p>
                        <p><b>2. Task Abandonment and Frustration</b>: When frustration did occur, participants often disengaged immediately, either by taking short breaks (e.g., scrolling on their phones) or abandoning the task altogether. However, it’s unclear whether these behaviors were intentional strategies for managing focus during long study sessions or simply signs of distraction or avoidance. We also don’t know if participants were trying to reengage effectively, or if the session was never intended to be particularly serious to begin with.</p>
                        <p>To explore these uncertainties, we developed interview questions aimed at understanding participants’ approaches to frustration, focus, and task management during study sessions. These questions help uncover their internal motivations, coping strategies, and perceptions of effective engagement, which were not directly observable in short library observations.</p>

                        <p>While these field observations provided initial behavioral insights, the library setting did not mirror the unstructured, distraction-prone conditions of homework environments, which were the primary context for our intervention. Observations alone could not capture intentions, perceptions, or coping strategies that underlay task transitions. To address these gaps, we shifted to a mixed-methods approach.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Live interviews yielded rich, contextual data about users’ internal states, intentions, and pain points.</li>
                            <li>Distributed self-report questionnaires provided complementary breadth and scalability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Together, these methods allowed us to capture motivational and emotional data absent in the (limited) library study.</p>
                        <h4><b>B. Interview/Questionnaire Protocol</b></h4>
                        <p>The interview guide was structured to be non-leading and exploratory. It focused on users’ task management habits, sources of distraction, emotional responses, and coping strategies. This design ensured that we obtained insight into both observable behavior and the underlying experiences that shaped task transitions.</p>

                            <li><b>Guided Micro-Breaks for Refocusing</b>: Users often grab their phones to recover focus, but risk “doom scrolling.” The system could suggest brief, 10–15 minute breaks with peripheral cues or small animations to gently bring users back to work. This leverages known behavioral patterns while mitigating extended distraction periods.</li>
                            <li><b>Flexible Time Management</b>: Rigid time-blocking is disruptive for many users. Incorporating a “task snooze” feature would allow users to extend or defer tasks without feeling constrained by strict schedules. Further research is needed to determine optimal snooze durations and conditions.</li>
                            <li><b>Learning Through Task Experience</b>: Rather than AI completing tasks for users, the system could gradually learn common task durations and provide suggested time allocations for future similar tasks, supporting users’ self-management skills.</li>
                            <li><b>Peripheral Cues Using Environmental Space</b>: Observations indicated that users often look above their screens when thinking or processing information. Leveraging this behavior, the system could use blank wall space near the desk to display subtle animations, reminders, or task progress in the user’s peripheral vision. This provides ambient task awareness, gently bringing users’ attention back to work during brief breaks or moments of overwhelm, without requiring direct interaction or risking phone distractions. See pictures below with empty wall space.</li>

                <div id="collapseUseCase" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingUseCase">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>Mia has just gotten home from her early morning design class. She sets her bag down and sits at her desk, ready for a long day of work. She feels a mix of emotions: excitement about starting some illustrations for a project due next week but also dreads about an academic paper due in two days. The paper requires a kind of analysis she’s never done before, and she doesn’t know how long it will take.</p>
                        <p>On the wall behind her screen, her Ambient Task Awareness Buddy glows softly. She’s nicknamed him ‘Wave’, since his projection sometimes shifts like ripples of water. The familiar presence calms her, and she feels less alone as she settles in.</p>
                        <p>She opens the ambient task awareness app and enters her projects: “Paper due Thursday (new analysis)” and “Illustrations due next week.” The system recognizes that one of her tasks is new and difficult to estimate. Wave ripples gently, prompting her to start the paper first since unpredictable tasks are harder to plan and the deadline is sooner. At the same time, Wave schedules time later in the evening for her illustration work, knowing she is more creative then.</p>
                        <p>Mia starts the paper. She opens the library databases, but after an hour she’s overwhelmed. The search terms aren’t working, the controlled vocabulary is unfamiliar, and results are frustratingly thin. In the past, this was where she might give up and cry. Instead, she taps her phone and asks Wave for help. The wall projection shifts to a slow, rhythmic animation designed to calm her breathing. She takes a short break with this guided rhythm and feels steadier.</p>
                        <p>Over the next few hours, Mia repeats this cycle: research → frustration → a quick break with Wave → renewed focus. Three short calming breaks with her “buddy” keep her going, and Wave proves to make her more productive, not less.</p>
                        <p>Altogether, she spends four focused hours on her paper. Wave provides subtle cues 30 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes before the end of her scheduled paper time. Instead of rushing, she calmly saves her search terms, downloads the most relevant articles, and organizes them properly, knowing she can continue tomorrow. Each cue has a familiar animation, so she knows exactly where she stands without needing to check the clock.</p>
                        <p>When it’s time to switch, Mia confirms with Wave that she’s moving on to her illustration task. Wave’s animation shifts again, signaling the change, and Mia notes in the app that she’ll need to schedule more time for the paper tomorrow. Now she can focus on her designs with a sense of relief: she hasn’t abandoned her hardest task, she’s made solid progress, and she has a plan.</p>

                        <p>The Ambient Task Awareness Projector integrates a Raspberry Pi 5-driven projector with a custom mobile app to deliver subtle, wall-based visual cues, such as color-coded waves and icons, synced to calendar APIs. It targets students and remote workers who spend long hours at desks and often miss task transitions due to muted notifications or headphone use. Many users reported a 4 or 5 on the scale for “I frequently lose more than 15 minutes transitioning between two different types of tasks,” highlighting that task-switching is a significant friction point, particularly for those with mostly fluid schedules. The system is engineered to proactively support new or unpredictable tasks, which are often difficult to estimate, providing peripheral reminders and pacing cues to prevent temporary overwhelm from escalating into full paralysis. Users can take guided micro-breaks or re-prioritize tasks before stress becomes catastrophic. A calm mode reduces anxiety, while flexible app control leverages unused wall space for peripheral awareness without disrupting immersion. This combination of hardware, software, and research-informed behavioral support helps users maintain focus and productivity, as demonstrated in Mia’s workflow for research and creative tasks.</p>

                            <li><b>Vs. Software-Only Tools (Todoist, MyStudyLife)</b>: Unlike these apps, which rely on intrusive notifications (pop-ups, sounds) that break focus, the projector provides physical, ambient visuals on the wall, avoiding screen-based interruptions. Clockwise and Morgen optimize schedules but lack hardware output, while Todoist and MyStudyLife focus on task lists/reminders, missing proactive transition cues.</li>
                            <li><b>Vs. Ambient Lighting (Philips Hue, Nanoleaf Panels)</b>: These offer basic color changes for notifications but lack the nuanced, schedule-specific animations (e.g., intensifying waves) and native calendar integration of the projector. Setup complexity and per-unit costs also contrast with the projector’s affordable DIY prototype (~$200-500).</li>
                            <li><b>Vs. Wearables (Apollo Neuro Wearable)</b>: Apollo provides passive vibration for stress relief without task scheduling, whereas the projector actively signals transitions, addressing the root cause (missed events) rather than symptoms (stress), with app control enhancing usability.</li>
                            <li><b>Vs. Physical Trackers (TimeFlip2)</b>: This app requires manual flips for logging, offering retrospective insights, while the projector automates awareness with real-time, calendar-driven visuals, reducing user effort and enabling forward-looking cues.</li>
                            <li><b>Vs. Distraction Blockers (TimeChi)</b>: TimeChi (defunct) and similar enforce focus with rigid blocks, lacking ambient feedback, whereas the projector gently signals transitions and allows postponement, better suiting creative, flexible workflows.</li>

                        <p><b>For Students (Mia – The Flowing creative)</b>: Mia’s workflow is inherently fluid and creative. She thrives on inspiration but struggles with task-switching, estimating new assignments, and maintaining focus under looming deadlines. Traditional student apps like MyStudyLife or Todoist are notification-heavy and often interrupt her flow with pop-ups or sounds, which she tends to mute, leaving her unaware of approaching deadlines or transitions. The projector addresses this by providing ambient, glanceable cues on the wall that subtly indicate task priority, approaching deadlines, and transitions between creative and analytical work. For example, a soft wave animation can signal that it’s time to shift from research to writing or from studying to illustration. This reduces her anxiety during long sessions and supports her natural rhythm, giving her control without rigidity.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, because the system can detect when a task is new or difficult, it can prompt her to start complex tasks early, helping prevent last-minute panic and paralysis, a capability that standard apps do not offer.</p>
                        <p><b>For Remote Workers (Daniel – The Agile Organizer)</b>: Daniel is structured, organized, and generally good at planning, but his environment poses challenges. Wearing headphones, being desk-bound, and juggling dynamic tasks can make it easy to miss transitions or updates. Unlike Philips Hue or Nanoleaf lights, which offer generic color cues, the projector provides schedule-specific, nuanced animations, for example subtle intensifying waves for imminent meetings, calm pulses for breaks. Its calm mode allows Daniel to manage high-focus periods without interruptions, while real-time, calendar-driven visuals reduce the cognitive load of manually tracking events. Compared to rigid focus tools or physical trackers, the projector allows him to adapt his workflow dynamically, postponing non-urgent tasks without losing overall awareness. For Daniel, this combination of flexible awareness and automation supports productivity in a way no existing tool provides.</p>
                        <p><b>General Advantages</b>: Across both personas, the projector’s ambient, peripheral design minimizes cognitive load by offloading the mental task of tracking schedules, reminders, and transitions. Unlike software-only tools or wearables, it provides forward-looking, real-time cues that align with the user’s natural workflow, whether creative (Mia) or structured (Daniel). Its automation ensures that tasks and deadlines are always visible peripherally without interrupting focus, while subtle animations and schedule-informed signals support emotional regulation and reduce stress. The projector’s DIY affordability and scalability make it accessible for students, remote workers, and multi-user setups, providing a system that is adaptable, long-term, and superior to existing software, wearables, or rigid physical trackers.</p>

                            <li>Timeline: With 6 weeks, allocating 1-2 weeks for development and 2 weeks for testing/deployment. Weekly 5-7 hours per member is manageable alongside other coursework.</li>
                            <li>Effort Breakdown: Hardware setup (10-15 hours total, 5-7 hours per member) covers projector mounting and calibration. Software (20-30 hours total, 12-15 hours per member) includes scheduler logic (10-15 hours), visuals (10-15 hours), app development (15-20 hours), and API (10-15 hours). This approximately aligns with 20-30 hours per member, leveraging existing tools (RPi OS, python libraries).</li>
                            <li>Resources: The hardware is accessible (RPi 5, projector owned) and the availability of free software (Flutter, Python libraries) minimizes barriers. Our skills reduce learning curves, and online tutorials (e.g., Adafruit, Flask docs) which support rapid prototyping.</li>
                            <li>Risk Mitigation: The design is modular which allows parallel work (e.g., app and visuals simultaneously). The weekly check-ins and a fallback plan (basic color cues if animations lag) ensure completion.</li>
                            <li>Feasibility: The 79-hour (approximately) total averages 25 - 28 hours per member, fitting the 20-30-hour guideline. The experience among the members minimizes learning curves. The pre-existing tools such as RPi Operating System, Flutter, and other python libraries along with well-defined online tutorials (such as Adafruit, Flask docs) support rapid progress. The risks (e.g., hardware delays) are mitigated by parallel work and a fallback (basic colors if animations lag).</li>
                            <li>Investment Plan: Each member commits to their planned hours, with flexibility to adjust. The weekly 6-9 hours investments are realistic, ensuring completion in due course.</li>

                            <li>Project/Study Description (2-3 sentences) Projector with subtle color and/or motion cues behind a user’s desk to signal upcoming task transitions. Geared toward students who frequently shift between different “mental vibes,” it syncs with calendars while also allowing users to reprioritize tasks, extend or shorten time blocks, and reschedule their day as needed. A built-in calming mode offers soothing light animations at the press of a button, helping users manage stress and stay focused.</li>
                            <li>Number and type of participants (gender, age range, other particulars such as athletes, farmers, musicians, etc.) We plan to recruit 6–10 students at McGill University, who are enrolled in 3 or more courses during the semester. This group represents individuals who frequently juggle multiple tasks and deadlines, and who may benefit from tools that help them stay on task and transition between activities. Participants will include a mix of genders and age ranges typical of undergraduate and graduate students (18–30).</li>
                            <li>How and from where are they recruited? Participants will be recruited directly from the McGill student body through classroom announcements, course discussion boards, and word of mouth. Recruitment will emphasize voluntary participation with no academic repercussions for declining.</li>
                            <li>What risk could this study entail for participants? The study involves minimal risk. At most, participants may experience mild discomfort from reflecting on their time-management challenges or from interruptions to their routine during observation or prototype testing.</li>
