    <h2>Phase 2: Hardware Acquisition and Setup (1 week)</h2>
    <p>Goal: Assemble and test the projector and RPi setup.</p>

    <h3>Acquire Hardware</h3>
    <p>Tasks: Purchase and gather components. Verify HDMI compatibility with your projector and RPi.</p>
    <p>Tools/Resources: Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB model, ~$50). MicroSD card (16GB+, Class 10, ~$10) for OS. Power supply for RPi (5V/3A USB-C adapter, ~$10). HDMI cable (if not owned, ~$5-10). Mounting: Adjustable projector mount (~$20-30) or tripod (~$15). Optional: HDMI-to-mini/micro adapter (~$5) if needed for your projector.</p>
    <p>Timeline: 1-2 days (plus shipping). Tips: Buy from reputable sources (e.g., Amazon, Raspberry Pi site); ensure cable length suits your setup.</p>

    <h3>Assemble and Wire the Hardware</h3>
    <p>Tasks: Flash RPi OS onto the SD card. Connect RPi to projector via HDMI. Mount the projector behind or above the monitor, aimed at the wall.</p>
    <p>Tools/Resources: Computer with SD card reader (for Raspberry Pi Imager, free download). Screwdriver set (~$10) for mounting. Multimeter (~$10) to check power (optional).</p>
    <p>Timeline: 2-3 days. Tips: Secure the mount to avoid movement; test projection angle to cover the wall evenly.</p>

    <h3>Basic Hardware Testing</h3>
    <p>Tasks: Power on the RPi and projector; display a test image (e.g., colored background) from the RPi desktop. Adjust focus, brightness, and position for ambient effect.</p>
    <p>Tools/Resources: HDMI monitor/keyboard/mouse (~$20-50 if not owned) for initial RPi setup. Power strip with surge protection (~$10).</p>
    <p>Timeline: 1-2 days. Tips: Use a dim setting to avoid screen glare; test in typical room lighting.</p>
